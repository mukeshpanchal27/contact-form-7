How to contribute to Contact Form 7
===================================

Thank you for considering contributing to Contact Form 7. This document explains how you can contribute to the project. We ask all contributors to read through this first.


Contributing by reporting issues
--------------------------------

If you find a bug, please report it to our GitHub repository unless it is about a security vulnerability. Creating an issue is always recommended, but for minor issues like correction of a typo, you can create a pull request instead of an issue.

If you can fix an issue, create a pull request that links to the target issue. For WordPress plugin development, we have our own [coding standards](https://contactform7.com/coding-standards/). We ask you to respect the standards in your coding as well.

Security issues should not be discussed publicly, so please don't publish it through GitHub or other channels when the issue is about a security vulnerability. For security vulnerabilities, it is recommended you use the [Wordfence vulnerability submission form](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/submit).

In any case, prior to reporting an issue, please double-check if the issue is caused purely due to a bug of the plugin's latest version. Confirm that the problem occurs even in a vanilla environment where only the WordPress core, the default theme, and the plugin itself are activated.

Receiving reports of issues that have little to do with the plugin negatively impacts the motivation of the developers. If you are uncertain, posting to the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-form-7/) is advised.


Contributing by helping other users
-----------------------------------

Coding is not the only way to contribute to an open source project. Helping other users is also a respected contribution.

Everyday, a lot of users come to the [official support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-form-7/) to post their support requests. If you feel you can answer their questions, please do not hesitate to do so.

Also, asking good questions in the public forum provides a great contribution. To properly ask a question, you are advised to read through the [forum guidelines](https://wordpress.org/support/welcome/) before posting.


Contributing with translation
-----------------------------

More than half of our users are non-English speakers who use Contact Form 7 in their local languages. Therefore, maintaining translations for their languages is a great help.

We use [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/contact-form-7/) (GlotPress) to manage translations for the Contact Form 7 plugin. This is a collaborative translation platform in which thousands of volunteer translators participate.

For details about how to join the translation project, see [Translating Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/translating-contact-form-7/).


Contributing with financial donations
-------------------------------------

You can contribute to the open source project even if you have no technical knowledge. We are asking for [donations](https://contactform7.com/donate/) to help developers sustain the development and support of the plugin.
